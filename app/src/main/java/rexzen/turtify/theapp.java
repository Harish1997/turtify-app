This could possibly be a reference to the supernumerary costal scute counts characteristic of this genus.The etymology of the English vernacular name \"olive\" is somewhat easier to resolve, as its carapace is olive green in color.However, the origin of \"ridley\" is still somewhat unclear, perhaps derived from \"riddle\".", R.drawable.oliveone1));

Males and females grow to the same size; however, females have a slightly more rounded carapace as compared to the male.The heart-shaped carapace is characterized by four pairs of pore-bearing inframarginal scutes on the bridge, two pairs of prefrontals, and up to 9 lateral scutes per side. Olive ridleys are unique in that they can have variable and asymmetrical lateral scute 6 to 8 counts ranging from five to 9 plates on each side, with six to eight being most commonly observed.Each side of the carapace has 12â€“14 marginal scutes.", R.drawable.olive1));

They lay their eggs in conical nests about one and a half feet deep which they laboriously dig with their hind flippers.In the Indian Ocean, the majority of olive ridleys nest in two or three large groups near Gahirmatha in Odisha. The coast of Odisha in India is the largest mass nesting site for the olive ridley, followed by the coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica.In 1991, over 600,000 turtles nested along the coast of Odisha in one week. Nesting occurs elsewhere along the Coromandel Coast and Sri Lanka, but in scattered locations. However, olive ridleys are considered a rarity in most areas of the Indian Ocean.", R.drawable.locations));
